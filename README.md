* To compile this blog, you need to install django first in your PC and all the dependencies necessary (when it's asked).

When it's okay, in your terminal:
# Enter in the project folder 
cd project_folder

# Activate the virtual environment
source virt/bin/activate

# Enter in the ablog folder
cd ablog
source .env

# Run the server
python (or python3) manage.py runserver

# After that, if you don't have an error, open your navigator and tip : localhost:8000

* For login, tip:
Username: admin
Password: djangoblog
